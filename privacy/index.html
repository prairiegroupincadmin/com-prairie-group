<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
<h2>Last Updated March 30, 2020</h2>

<p>
We at Prairie Group Inc. (“Prairie,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) created this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) because we know that you care about how information you provide to us is used and shared.  This Privacy Policy relates to the information collection and use practices of Prairie Group in connection with our online services (the “Services”), which are made available to you through our website located at [INSERT BETA SITE ADDRESS LINK] (the “Site”), and our mobile app (the “App”).
By visiting our Site and/or using our App and/or Services, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms of Use. Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning set forth in our Terms of Use.

</p>

<h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT</h2>

<h3>Contact and Registered User Information
</h3>
<p>
When you sign up to become a registered user, when you contact us through the “Contact Us” link, or sign up for our newsletters, you will be asked to provide us with certain information, such as your first name, last name and email address. In this Privacy Policy, we refer to this information as “Contact Information.” Typically, we do not collect Contact Information from you unless you provide us with the Contact Information voluntarily.
</p>

<h3>Geolocational Information  
</h3>
<p>
In order to use the App, we may, with your prior permission, collect geolocational information from your mobile device, your wireless carrier, or certain third-party service providers (“Geolocational Information”).  Collection of such Geolocational Information occurs only when the App is running on your mobile device.  You may decline to allow us to collect such Geolocational Information, in which case we will not be able to provide certain services to you.  Because your Geolocational Information is subject to abuse by others, please be sure to manage your mobile device and privacy preferences on the App on an ongoing basis.
</p>

<h3>Other Information</h3>
<p>
In addition to the Contact Information, we may collect additional information (collectively, “Other Information”).  Such Other Information may include:

Like most web sites, we use automatic data collection technology when you visit the Site to record information that identifies your computer, to track your use of our Site, and to collect certain basic information about you and your surfing habits.

From Cookies. We, and/or third-party service providers, collect information using “cookie” technology.  Cookies are small packets of data that a website stores on your computer’s or mobile device’s hard drive so that your computer will “remember” information about your visit to our Site or App.  We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to help us collect information and to enhance your experience using the Site or App.  If you do not want us to place a cookie on your hard drive, you may be able to turn that feature off on your computer or mobile device.  Please consult your Internet browser’s documentation for information on how to do this and how to delete persistent cookies.  However, if you decide not to accept cookies from us, the Site or App may not function properly.
Third Party Analytics.  We may use one or more third-party analytics services to evaluate your use of the Site or the App, compile reports on activity, collect demographic data, analyze performance metrics, and collect and evaluate other information relating to the Site or the App. These third parties use cookies and/or other technologies to help analyze and provide us the data. By accessing and using the Site or the App, you consent to the processing of data about you by these analytics providers in the manner and for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. Please be advised that if you opt out of any service, you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Site or the App.
